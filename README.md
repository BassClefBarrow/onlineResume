Synopsis

I enroled in Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree (IPND) and this is the project for Front End. The reason I enroled was to get a taste for various programming applications to broaden my scope for a career change.

I had a bit of difficulty choosing an extracurricular project but I settled on Front End. I think doing this project has highlighted that I don't really know enough about CSS. As a result I haven't done much to alter the style of the template. Anyway, I have used some real and some fictional info to populate the data.

The index file holds the bones of the resume. helper.js contains lots of helpfuil titbits used to apply styles to data, among other things. resumeBuilder.js has most of my code in it which includes many objects for the resume. OF course, style.css has the proforma styles to be applied throughout.

I think this is a useful project and I may eventually update it with my real info and use it in future job applications.
